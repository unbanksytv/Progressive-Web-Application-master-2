PWA of LTL Maps. (React/AWS S3/ZEIT). Fixing unreliable reviews. Five-star systems are good at identifying and weeding out very low-quality places, they do a poor job of separating good from great. Who has a similar lifestyle and worldview? Get trustworthy recommendations from your friends and add their favorite places to your own map.
